							<p class="co-op__description">
								I worked remotely as a Software Developer at
								Camis given the current pandemic. I was provided
								with all the necessary tools and setup needed to
								develop, and contribute to the Camis Software
								from home.
							</p>
							<p class="co-op__description">
								The Camis Software consists of two separate
								applications. The first is a fully-fledged web
								application where customers can make their own
								reservations at parks. The second is a desktop
								application designed for call centers to make
								park reservations for customers.
							</p>
							<p class="co-op__description">
								The web application was primarily built on top
								of Angular with Typescript, RxJs, and an ASP.NET
								core backend, while the desktop application was
								developed with C# for the application logic, WPF
								for the user interfaces, and SQL for the
								database.
							</p>
							<p class="co-op__description">
								JavaScript was always my second language of
								choice after C as I had some experience with it
								from school (CIS*2750) and my side projects. I
								always wanted to extend my knowledge by working
								with a JavaScript frontend framework such as
								Angular or React and I was in luck! At Camis, I
								was part of the Booking Squad where my day to
								day task mostly involved working with Angular,
								Typescript, and C# to rapidly implement new
								features, maintain both the web and desktop
								applications, and improve the user experience
								for our customers. We used the agile (scrum)
								development approach to organize and tackle our
								day to day work and meet our priorities and
								deadlines.

								When I started at Camis, I had very little
								knowledge of how the Scrum framework and Jira
								worked. I started watching videos on Scrum and
								Jira to get myself familiar with the terms and
								methods used to manage daily tasks. Very soon, I
								was able to estimate a ticket properly with my
								team, using story points, and divide epics into
								smaller manageable tasks.
							</p>
							<p class="co-op__description">
								I also kept track of the number of story points
								I completed per sprint to measure my “velocity”
								and time management. Over the course of the
								term, I was praised for the productivity of my
								work and for being a fast learner.

								A team player is essential in the software
								development industry. Personally, I tend to
								develop this skill by attending daily scrum
								meetings in the morning with my team, where I
								discuss the work that I am doing in the current
								sprint. I was also involved in “planning poker”
								sessions where we assigned story point estimates
								to future tickets. Other meetings involved
								planning implementation strategies for new
								features and attending tech forums where we
								learned something new every week about the
								technology stack we use. Fridays were the most
								fun as we played JackBox games with team members
								of different squads.
							</p>
							<p class="co-op__description">
								On the technical side, to get more familiar with
								the codebase of Camis, I started to pair-program
								with my mentor (buddy) every day for an hour,
								where he explained the business objects of the
								code and showed me new tricks of the tools I was
								using. The active learning environment at Camis
								was my favorite part of working there; my squad
								always helped me whenever I needed them and
								challenged me with exciting new work every
								sprint.

								I was fortunate to gain some hands-on experience
								with Angular in this work term. Angular has a
								vast ecosystem with a very complex architecture
								with which we can rapidly develop single-page
								applications; it integrates very well with
								Typescript and RxJs. For me, I first started
								learning Angular when my mentor assigned me a
								ticket worth 13 story points that involved
								making a component from scratch.
							</p>
							<p class="co-op__description">
								I started taking courses and watching tutorials
								online on Angular. I put everything I learned
								into practice by doing the component work, I was
								assigned and picked up some nifty Typescript
								tricks along the way. The use of RxJs changed
								the way I looked at asynchronous code as I come
								from a promise-based JavaScript background.
								Throughout the term, I integrated this new
								component in several parts of the web
								application. Consequently, my work also involved
								maintaining the other parts of the web
								application where I used Angular and Typescript
								heavily to merge and ship production code.
