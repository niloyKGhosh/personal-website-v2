							<p class="co-op__description">
								I worked remotely as a Software Developer at
								Camis given the current pandemic. I was provided
								with all the necessary tools and setup needed to
								develop, and contribute to the Camis Software
								from home.
							</p>
							<p class="co-op__description">
								The Camis Software consists of two separate
								applications. The first is a fully-fledged web
								application where customers can make their own
								reservations at parks. The second is a desktop
								application designed for call centers to make
								park reservations for customers.
							</p>
							<p class="co-op__description">
								The web application was primarily built on top
								of Angular with Typescript, RxJs, and an ASP.NET
								core backend, while the desktop application was
								developed with C# for the application logic, WPF
								for the user interfaces, and SQL for the
								database.
							</p>
							<p class="co-op__description">
								JavaScript was always my second language of
								choice after C as I had some experience with it
								from school (CIS*2750) and my side projects. I
								always wanted to extend my knowledge by working
								with a JavaScript frontend framework such as
								Angular or React and I was in luck! At Camis, I
								was part of the Booking Squad where my day to
								day task mostly involved working with Angular,
								Typescript, and C# to rapidly implement new
								features, maintain both the web and desktop
								applications, and improve the user experience
								for our customers. We used the agile (scrum)
								development approach to organize and tackle our
								day to day work and meet our priorities and
								deadlines.

								When I started at Camis, I had very little

								was able to estimate a ticket properly with my
								team, using story points, and divide epics into
								smaller manageable tasks.
							</p>
							<p class="co-op__description">
								I also kept track of the number of story points
								I completed per sprint to measure my “velocity”

								A team player is essential in the software
								development industry. Personally, I tend to
								develop this skill by attending daily scrum
								meetings in the morning with my team, where I
								discuss the work that I am doing in the current

								sessions where we assigned story point estimates
								to future tickets. Other meetings involved
								planning implementation strategies for new
								features and attending tech forums where we
								learned something new every week about the
								technology stack we use. Fridays were the most
								fun as we played JackBox games with team members
								of different squads.
							</p>
							<p class="co-op__description">
								On the technical side, to get more familiar with
								the codebase of Camis, I started to pair-program
								with my mentor (buddy) every day for an hour,
								where he explained the business objects of the
								code and showed me new tricks of the tools I was
								using. The active learning environment at Camis
								was my favorite part of working there; my squad
								always helped me whenever I needed them and
								challenged me with exciting new work every

							<p class="co-op__description">
								I started taking courses and watching tutorials

								the way I looked at asynchronous code as I come
								from a promise-based JavaScript background.
								Throughout the term, I integrated this new
								component in several parts of the web
								application. Consequently, my work also involved
								maintaining the other parts of the web
								application where I used Angular and Typescript
								heavily to merge and ship production code.

								At Camis, any pull request goes through three
								stages of testing: Unit, Integration, and End to
								End testing. In this framework, my primary role
								was to work on unit tests for every
								feature/component I made. When implementing
								these components on Angular, I applied
								test-driven development, where I created failing
								test cases and then built the component code
								based on these cases. During this, I was
								subjected to the Jest testing framework which is
								used to write tests for JavaScript/TypeScript
								applications.
							</p>
							<p class="co-op__description">
								My other tasks involved creating a mini-feature
								for the desktop application using C# and WPF. I
								primarily approached this by watching C# videos
								online to get used to the syntax and
								pair-programming with my Team Lead. The
								mini-feature was designed to allow the call
								center agents to delete multiple bookings in one
								click. However, due to time constraints, I was
								not able to experience ASP.NET to the full
								extent but I plan to explore the boundaries of
								ASP.NET and C# more in the future.

							<p class="co-op__description">
								Admittedly, it was not easy to learn angular at
								first, but since my entire work was centered
								around angular, I quickly learned the
								awe-inspiring power of angular that it gives to
								developers like me. It allowed me to reuse
								components without repeating code (unlike HTML
								and CSS) and rapidly create component based
								single-page applications.

								Awesome TypeScript
								<span class="hashtag">#</span>
							</h3>

							<p class="co-op__description">
								TypeScript turned out to be a revelation for me!
								It’s implications in large-scale applications
								and the strict type checking meant that I could
								write JavaScript code with a lot more confidence
								than I previously could.

							<p class="co-op__description">
								Needless to say, testing is paramount to any
								development cycle. It ensures I can write and
								maintain bulletproof code and also avoid
								potential bugs once the code is changed.

							<h3 class="goals-subheading pt-4">
								Learning to use your tools and shortcuts is

							</h3>

							<p class="co-op__description">
								Using tools like debuggers, VS code shortcuts,
								and chrome developer tools gave me an important
								realization - although they may be simple, they
								are fundamental to improving my productivity and
								decreasing my development time.
							</p>
							<p class="co-op__description">
								In conclusion, these takeaways will definitely
								help me to move forward in my career. After this
